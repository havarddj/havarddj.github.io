I am a researcher in algebraic number theory. I did my DPhil (i.e. PhD) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [James Newton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/newton/) and [Jan Vonk](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vonkjb/), and supported by an [Aker scholarship](https://www.akerscholarship.org). Prior to this, I obtained a BSc (Hons) at the University of Edinburgh with my third year spent at Caltech. 

My research area is broadly speaking algebraic number theory or arithmetic geometry, and I am particularly interested in explicit class field theory, modular forms, and analogies between the archimedean and _p_-adic worlds.
