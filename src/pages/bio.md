I am a mathematician working in algebraic number theory. I am currently a visiting fellow at the [Max Planck Institute in Bonn](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/).

I obtained my DPhil (i.e. PhD) from the University of Oxford in 2024, supervised by [James Newton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/newton/) and [Jan Vonk](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vonkjb/), and supported by an [Aker scholarship](https://www.akerscholarship.no). 

I am particularly interested in explicit class field theory, modular forms, and analogies between the archimedean and $p$-adic worlds.
