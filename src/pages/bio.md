I am a mathematician working in algebraic number theory. 

I did my DPhil (i.e. PhD) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [James Newton](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/newton/) and [Jan Vonk](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vonkjb/), and supported by an [Aker scholarship](https://www.akerscholarship.no). 

I am particularly interested in explicit class field theory, modular forms, and analogies between the archimedean and $p$-adic worlds.
