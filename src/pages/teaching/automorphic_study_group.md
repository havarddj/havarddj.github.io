<!-- ## Automorphic representations learning seminar -->

This is a learning seminar mainly intended for masters and graduate
students at Oxford, but everyone is welcome! If you have any questions,
contact me or [Zach](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/zhechen.feng).
The goal is to cover the most important sections of [Jayce Getz\'s
notes](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jgetz/aut_reps.pdf), and to
develop the skills needed work with automorphic forms and
representations.


### Prerequisites:

We will assume few prerequisites beyond some knowledge of number fields and basic
representation theory.

### Schedule:

We will meet on **Thursdays 13:30 in Room C5**, which is the same time
slot as the modularity lifting seminar last term.

Below is a tentative list of topics we intend to cover, although we\'ll
probably have to go beyond Hilary term if we want to cover all of them.

| Topic                                         | Speaker  | Notes                            |
