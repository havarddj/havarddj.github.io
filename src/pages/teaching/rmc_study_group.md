## Goal
The aim is to understand the paper [Rigid meromorphic cocycles for orthogonal groups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14433) by Darmon, Gehrmann and Lipnowski. 

## Schedule

We will meet on **Thursdays 10:30 in the seminar room**, with the following exceptions: 
- the first talk will be Friday at noon + $\epsilon$ 
- the talk on November 14th will be in the admin conference room due to a conference

Below is a tentative plan for the talks.
