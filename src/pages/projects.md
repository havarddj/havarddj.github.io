+ [drawspec](https://github.com/havarddj/drawspec) \
A simple script building on [pytikz](https://github.com/allefeld/pytikz) to draw the spectrum of the ring of integers in a number field. Conveniently, this also generates tikz code for use in LaTeX documents. A version of this is included in the LMFDB, see  [example](https://www.lmfdb.org/NumberField/7.1.3911915096945863.1) and [slides](/talks/lucant25).
	    
+ [typst-preview.el](https://github.com/havarddj/typst-preview.el) \
An Emacs package for live preview of [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern LaTeX alternative.

+ [tree-sitter-sage](https://github.com/havarddj/tree-sitter-sage) \
A tree-sitter grammar for SageMath, which is a slight modification of [tree-sitter-python](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python).

+ [tree-sitter-magma](https://github.com/edgarcosta/tree-sitter-magma/ \
A tree-sitter grammar for hte [magma](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) computer algebra system.

+ [WCLvsSCL](https://github.com/havarddj/WCLvsSCL) \
Some code for computing the probabilistic zeta function of a finite poset lattice. Includes code which disproves a conjecture in (a previous version of) [arxiv:2112.13766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13766).
