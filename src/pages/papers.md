1. **On a theorem of Rickards** \
_Preprint_ <[pdf](/rickards_paper_arxiv_v1.pdf)>\
[James Rickards](https://jamesrickards-canada.github.io/) proved that
the generating series of intersection numbers of real quadratic
geodesics on indefinite Shimura curves are elliptic modular forms. We
reinterpret this as a Kudla--Millson theta series, and prove that his
generating series is the diagonal restriction of a Hilbert modular
form, analogous to results of Darmon--Pozzi--Vonk and Branchereau.

Algorithms for computing Gross-Stark units and Stark-Heegner points using overconvergent  modular forms, with implementations
in [magma](https://github.com/havarddj/drd) and [sage](https://github.com/havarddj/hilbert-eisenstein).

2. **Diagonal Restrictions of Hilbert Modular Forms** \
_DPhil Thesis, University of Oxford, 2024_ <[pdf](/dphil_thesis.pdf)> \
We extend the results of [DPV21] to ring class characters, or equivalently, to values
of analytic theta cocycles at non-fundamental RM points. The
main contribution is an explicit adelic construction of Hilbert
Eisenstein series transforming with respect to SL2(𝒪) where 𝒪
is a non-maximal order in a real quadratic field.
